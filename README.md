# Crypto-catalog
It a clone of <a href="https://hodlinfo.com/">hodlinfo</a>
where Im using there <a href="https://api.wazirx.com/api/v2/tickers">API</a>

I'm taking the Top10 crypto list and by using node.js and mongodb ,I'm storing the data,<br>
By using the ejs file I'm rendering it.

It's not fully responsive yet,but for pc devices it works just fine.

Happy coding! :)
